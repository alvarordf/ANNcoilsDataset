# ANNcoils_dataset
Electromagnetic FEA simulations of coupled coils for IMDs from the article **Neural Network-Based Design of Wireless Power Transfer Systems for Implantable Medical Devices** (Álvaro Rodríguez Fuentes, Miguel Jiménez Carrizosa, Regina Ramos Hortal).
## Description of the dataset
The dataset includes geometric and electrical data of coupled multilayer squared planar coils. **4635** simulations were performed using the electromagnetic FEA software *Ansys HFSS 2025 R1*. This data was used to train an Artificial Neural Network using the *Neural Net Fitting* application of *MATLAB*.
The file includes:
### Simulation inputs: geometry
The coupled coils of the simulations are defined by their geometry. Thus, the inputs of the simulations are included in columns 1 to 16. These variables are represented in the following figure:

### Simulation outputs: electrical variables
The outputs of the simulations are the electrical parameters of the inductive link. The FEA software resolves the system as a two-port network, yielding the complex impedance matrix of the system:
$\mathbf{U} =\mathbf{Z}\cdot\mathbf{I}$; 

Their complex values are included in columns 17-20. From the impedance matrix (Z-matrix), the electrical variables of the inductive link are extracted (columns 20-28):

20. **L1 (uH)**: Self inductance of primary coil, in uH.

$L_1=\frac{1}{2\pi f_{sw}} \Im{(Z_{11})}$

21. **L2 (uH)**: Self inductance of secondary coil, in uH.

24. **k**: Coupling factor of the inductive link.

$k=\frac{\Im{(Z_{12})}}{\sqrt{\Im{(Z_{11})}\Im{(Z_{22})}}}$

25. **Q1**: Quality factor of primary coil.

$Q_1=\frac{\Im{(Z_{11})}}{\Re{(Z_{11})}}$

26. **Q2**: Quality factor of secondary coil.

27. **Ro**: optimal output load, in Ohms.

$\eta_{max} = \frac{k^2Q_1Q_2}{(1+\sqrt{1+k^2Q_1Q_2})^2}$
 
## Usage
This repository includes two versions of the dataset: a .csv file and a .mat file. The .mat file includes a table (ANNCoilsFEA) and three arrays:
- **In**: includes the 10 geometrical variables that represent the inputs of the ANN: (W1, W2, S1, S2, N1, N2, Dext1, Dext2, Nlay1, Nlay2).
- **Out**: includes the 5 electrical variables that represent the outputs of the ANN: (L1, L2, R1, R2, k).
- **Out_norm**: includes the 5 electrical variables that represent the outputs of the ANN. These variables are preprocessed to enhance the regression capabilities of the ANN: (log10(L1), log10(L2), log10(R1), log10(R2), k)
The ANN can be created and trained using the *Neural Net Fitting* application of *MATLAB*, either by its graphical GUI or generating the training code. 

## Additional information
More information about how to properly train the ANN and adjust their hyperparameters can be found in the article **Neural Network-Based Design of Wireless Power Transfer Systems for Implantable Medical Devices** (Álvaro Rodríguez Fuentes, Miguel Jiménez Carrizosa, Regina Ramos Hortal).
